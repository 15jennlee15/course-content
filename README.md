# Penultimate syllabus
Summer course content for Neuromatch Academy (NMA)
July 13-31, 2020

**Objectives**: Introduce traditional and emerging computational neuroscience tools, their complementarity, and what they can tell us about the brain. A main focus is on modeling choices, model creation, model evaluation and understanding how they relate to biological questions.

**Tutorial microstructure**: ~10min talk, ~20min tutorial (repeated)

**Day structure**: 4h methods, 1h interpretation (what did we learn today, what does it mean, underlying philosophy, 1h professional development/ meta-science, evening group projects for interactive track). There will also be many networking activities!

**Prerequisites**: [See here](https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/precourse)

## Week 1
### Mon, July 13: Introduction to Computational Neuroscience and NMA

**Goal**: Introduction of datasets (spikes, EEG, fMRI + behavior), and questions about them. These questions will foreshadow the whole summer school.

*Lecturers*: TBA

**Intro / keynote & tutorial setup** (0:00 - 0:50): NMA organization, expectations, code of conduct, modeling vs. data

| Lecture & tutorial 1 | Lecture & tutorial 2 | Lecture & tutorial 3 | Lecture & tutorial 4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0:50 - 1:25 | 1:30 - 2:05 | 2:10 - 2:45 | 3:30 - 4:05 |
| Data intro, preprocessing | Link of neural data to behavior | Tuning (RFs, motor, STA) | What it means to "understand" (signal detection) |

**Recap, Q&A** (4:35 - 5:30): Outlook on school

**Professional development** (5:30 - 6:00): Being a good NMA participant


### Tue, July 14: What do models buy us?

**Goal**: Introduce different example model types (Marr 1-3, what/how/why) and the kinds of questions they can answer. MRealize how different models map onto different datasets.

*Lecturers*: TBD

**Intro / keynote & tutorial setup** (0:00 - 0:50): Model classifications 

| Lecture & tutorial 1 | Lecture & tutorial 2 | Lecture & tutorial 3 | Lecture & tutorial 4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0:50 - 1:25 | 1:30 - 2:05 | 2:10 - 2:45 | 3:30 - 4:05 |
| Marr 1 | Marr 2-3 | "What" | "How"/"Why" |

**Recap, Q&A** (4:35 - 5:30): The role of models in discovery

**Professional development** (5:30 - 6:00): How-to-model guide 1
