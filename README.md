# Penultimate syllabus
Summer course content for Neuromatch Academy (NMA)
July 13-31, 2020

**Objectives**: Introduce traditional and emerging computational neuroscience tools, their complementarity, and what they can tell us about the brain. A main focus is on modeling choices, model creation, model evaluation and understanding how they relate to biological questions.

**Tutorial microstructure**: ~10min talk, ~20min tutorial (repeated)

**Day structure**: 4h methods, 1h interpretation (what did we learn today, what does it mean, underlying philosophy, 1h professional development/ meta-science, evening group projects for interactive track). There will also be many networking activities!

**Prerequisites**: [See here](https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/precourse)

## Week 1
### Mon, July 13: Introduction to Computational Neuroscience and NMA

**Goal**: We introduce the datasets (spikes, EEG, fMRI + behavior), and ask questions about them. These questions will foreshadow the whole summer school
