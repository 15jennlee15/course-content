# The zen of reviewing tutorials for Neuromatch Academy (NMA)

Thank you for agreeing to review tutorials for NMA!

How can tutorial content reviewers contribute to material authored by domain experts? Reviewers that are domain experts help double-checking scientific content. Non-experts contribute to alignment and consistency, which applies to all content in NMA.

## Contribution scope
Content creators design materials for a particular day. Reviewers see materials across days and assist in polishing them for publication. Creators and reviewers work together in iterative loops to improve consistency with the other days.

Content reviewers follow 3 to 5 days of tutorials, and at least two reviewers see each content.

## Reference documents
These are the main areas for alignment and consistency: 
* Learning objectives and tutorial content from [One-page Topic/Lecture summaries](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mrXdVGgPqb-NVVLZj3E0FWETp9z-L9I-)
* Guidelines for [Writing tutorials for Neuromatch Academy (NMA)](https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/course-content/blob/master/tutorials/writing-tutorials.md)
* Python guidelines and best practices from [Python-standards](https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/course-content/blob/master/tutorials/python-standards.md)
* Consistent math notation and formatting defined in [Standardized nomenclature, math, fonts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z3Bc0oQA4a-y3xJU2mtIDMAOen1SO8AmUjkc3_xFOPM/edit)
* Self-consistency: Each slide deck and notebook stands on its own, except for dependencies from other days

## Content review workflow
1. Content creators post links to new material on Slack channel `#content-reviews` with **comment permissions**.
2. Content review team adds these links to the sheet [Content Review Sign-Up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LtLEk0H7gkR34kXJVC3hICUsLwfabbSjTPSlterB-xg/edit)
3. Reviewers comment directly on docs or colab notebooks or reply in Slack threads
4. Materials migrate to Github after reaching initial draft status, and reviews continue there
